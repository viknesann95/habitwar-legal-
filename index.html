    <h1>HabitWar Data Deletion</h1>
    <p>At <strong>HabitWar</strong>, we value your privacy. Because our app is designed as a local-first utility, most of your data stays on your device.</p>
    
    <h3>Local Data (Habits & Tasks)</h3>
    <p>All your habits, tasks, and progress data are stored locally on your device. This data is permanently deleted automatically when you uninstall the app from your phone.</p>

    <h3>Purchase History & Pro Features</h3>
    <p>If you have purchased the Pro version, a record of the transaction (Purchase Token and Transaction ID) is stored by Google Play to verify your license. We do not store your credit card or personal identity on our own servers.</p>

    <h3>How to Request Deletion</h3>
    <p>If you would like to request the manual removal of your purchase record from our internal logs, please email us with your request:</p>
    <p><strong>Email:</strong> gridmendigital@gmail.com</p>
